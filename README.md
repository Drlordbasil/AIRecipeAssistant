# AI-Driven Recipe Recommendation

Create a Python program that utilizes AI models and web scraping techniques to generate personalized recipe recommendations for users. The program will rely on libraries like BeautifulSoup and Google Python to scrape recipe websites and extract relevant information. It will analyze user preferences such as dietary restrictions, preferred cuisines, and cooking time constraints to provide tailored recipe suggestions. The AI component will continuously learn from user feedback to improve its recommendations over time, ensuring a more personalized and accurate experience. The program will also allow users to save their favorite recipes and generate shopping lists based on the ingredients required.

## Functionalities

1. **Web Scraping**: Utilize BeautifulSoup or similar libraries to scrape popular recipe websites for a wide variety of recipes. Extract relevant information such as ingredients, cooking instructions, and user ratings to build a comprehensive recipe database.

2. **User Preference Analysis**: Implement a user interface where users can input their dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.), preferred cuisines, and cooking time constraints. The program will analyze this information to generate customized recipe recommendations.

3. **AI Model Integration**: Utilize pre-trained AI models from OpenAI or Huggingface to analyze the textual data of recipes and identify patterns and similarities. The models will help in generating personalized recommendations based on user preferences and suggest alternative ingredient options or substitutions.

4. **Continuous Learning**: Incorporate a feedback system where users can rate and provide feedback on the suggested recipes. The AI algorithm will analyze this feedback to improve future recommendations and learn from user preferences over time, creating a smarter and more personalized recommendation system.

5. **Shopping List Generation**: Provide users with the option to save favorite recipes and generate a shopping list based on the ingredients required. The program can also suggest recipes based on the ingredients a user already has in their pantry, reducing food waste and encouraging creative cooking.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries by running the following command:
    ```
    pip install beautifulsoup4 google-python
    ```

2. Run the `main.py` file using Python:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```

3. Follow the prompts to input your dietary restrictions, preferred cuisines, and cooking time constraints.

4. The program will generate personalized recipe recommendations based on your inputs.

5. Rate the suggested recipes and provide feedback to enhance future recommendations.

6. Save your favorite recipes and generate a shopping list based on the ingredients required.
